# CCask

A C implementation of the Bitcask KV store.

# Project-wide TODO

Writing TODOs here that aren't covered by reproducing the core functionality described in the Bitcask paper.

* Implement more robust error handling (set errno values & read them)
* Add DEBUG flags to have cleaner or more verbose logs
* Implement reading an existing file & populating keydir
* Remove redundant imports
